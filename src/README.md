=== My Wiki

Often, we invest substantial effort into solving problems, only to encounter similar challenges months or even years later. I am not fond of redundancy or revisiting the same issues repeatedly. To circumvent this inefficiency, I have proactively begun documenting my processes and solutions. This documentation serves as a valuable reference, enabling me to quickly replicate successful outcomes without unnecessary duplication of effort, ensuring smarter, not harder, work practices.

#### Professional Highlights

- **Award-Winning Publications**: Proud recipient of the 1st prize for two consecutive years for the best electronic publication in South Africa with TUT's monthly newsletter, **HEITA**. This achievement underscores my commitment to excellence in digital media.
  
- **Versatile Development Experience**: Founder of webAlly, a unique web development firm that uniquely bridged the gap between digital and print media. While outsourcing non-electronic media, I maintained a hands-on approach to all development projects to foster continuous learning and innovation. My deep-seated passion for programming drives every venture, ensuring cutting-edge solutions that keep development in-house.
  
- **Gaming Success Story**: In 2019, I spearheaded the creation and launch of **Tinbo Dash**, an infinite runner game for PC and Android developed for McDonald's.

#### HeEPP - Hyper Extensible Element Pre-Processor

- **Innovative Framework Development**: My freelance career, characterized by repetitive project types, inspired the creation of reusable modules that evolved into a robust framework originally named `webCore`.

- **Pioneering Modular Design**: I named it HeEPP (Hyper Extensible Element Pre-Processor) to reflect its core functionality—facilitating the creation of reusable elements that significantly enhance development efficiency. This system allows for the extension and nesting of elements, similar to concepts later popularized by Google Polymer, but with a full-stack approach that predates its front-end only solutions.

- **Technical Mastery and Community Engagement**: HeEPP allows developers to define custom HTML tags, known as elements, which pair with corresponding PHP classes to render dynamically based on their attributes. This approach not only streamlines development but ensures stability and ease of maintenance. As I continue to finalize the documentation in 2022, my goal is to foster a community of contributors and elevate HeEPP to compete with leading frameworks like Laravel by 2024

=== SENOR FULL-STACK PHP DEVELOPER

### Dec 2011 - Feb 2014 : Principal Software (D6 Group)     Pretoria

When I worked for d6 Group it was still known as Principal Software. I believe the main focus of the company is still admin systems for schools. When I started they rolled out to 30 schools, each school on their own server and own code base. This presented many challenges:

- New updates were a process of deploying the code and DB migrations on 30 servers.
- It took an entire day and if there was a complication at just one school we did a rollback on all.

The first update I proposed was to combine all code bases. This presented a bigger callenge than I thought for some strange reasons. The whole system was written in 1 very, very, very long PHP file. I believe it was a 12MB text file. What I found out later was that the original developer was in fact blind and coded the whole system with text to speech and knowing almost exactly what line of code did what. I was honestly impressed and shocked at the same time.

- I took some time and I split the file into hundreds of smaller files
- The first update I did was deploying the same code, but just split into smaller pieces, but just to one server and we created sub-domains for each school, the sub-domain also determined the DB name the system connected to. We decided to leave each school on their own database since none of the tables had a `school_id` or any unique identifier that would differentiate each school's data
- During the time I was there the company grew from being 3 people to more than 40 with over 2000 schools using the system with almost a million users. Working for this company was a real adventure and I enjoyed every day. I loved the people and how the product evolved.

#### Reason for leaving

=== LEAD WEB DEVELOPER

### Dec 2005 - Feb 2006 : PageWorks           Pretoria

PageWorks was a Advertising Agency, this was my first job where I was employed specifically for just web-development, but my title at the office was HEAD WEB DEVELOPER, I guess that was only because I was the only one, and not because I was in change of anyone else. We did however employ two more people in the department during the course of the year it felt good doing my title justice.
This was during the time of IE6, JQuery just started getting some traction and most websites were images cut up into tables. The web was very simplistic, you could only safely use 5 different fonts, I knew all the CSS rules, I honestly did not think JavaScript had any future, I treated it as a bad joke, I honestly believe that if Jquery did not come and save JavasScript then it might have been trashed together with Objective C, Turbo Pascal and AT&T Unix Operating System.

=== IT TECHNICIAN / WEB DEVELOPER

### Aug 2004 - Dec 2005 : PC Palace           Pretoria

- I was studying to become a lawyer back then, but to pay for my studies I started working at PC Palace as a techie. I've always had an interest in computers and I knew much o what I knew back then by just playing around at home, constantly reinstalling Windows 95 from 22 2.5" Disks that I bought on special from CNA's grand opening in Menlyn mall for R20. Before the days of owning a CD-ROM and before you could hope to download more than 10MB over an entire weekend.
- The technical department booked in repairs with an Access database running on the Windows Server 2003. The database constantly kicked people out and caused loads of frustration. That is when I decided to create my very first website, I did some research and decided on a LAMP Stack, I've got no idea how it happened that I chose Apache, PHP and Mysql. It took me about two months and many sleepless nights but I completed the new system for the technical department. After that they put me in charge of the company website. Then some of the company's clients also started paying them for development until PageWorks offered me the Lead Web Developer role for 6 times what I was earing at PC Palace.
That was it, I never looked back.

#### Reason for leaving

While working as a technician at PC Palace during my studies, I identified inefficiencies in the company's internal job tracking system and took the initiative to develop a new system in my spare time, completing it within two months. The system was adopted and improved workflow significantly. I was also entrusted with redesigning the company website. After these contributions, I received an offer for a Web Developer role at PageWorks, which presented a significant career advancement opportunity.
